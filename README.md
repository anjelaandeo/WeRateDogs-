# (WeRateDogs, Wrangling and Analyze Data)
## by (Anjela M. Andeo)


## Overview 
> In this project, the dataset that is undergoing data wrangling process is the tweet archive of Twitter user “@dog_rates” also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people’s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.
## Summary of Findings

- For the first insight, it was observed that pupper is the most popular dog stage, followed by doggo, puppo and then floofer being the least. The observation was done on both histogram and a pie-chart. Pupper having a higher turnout compared to the rest would mean that people tend to concentrate more on taking dogs pictures while they are still young.
- For the second insight, I opted for a scatter plot and then performed a test to get the correlation between retweet and favorite count. The result yielded was +0.70 which indicates a positive correlation between the two variables. That would mean that the higher the number of tweets the  higher the possibility for it to be retweeted.

- For the third insight, the outcome showed that the number of retweets wasn’t consistent over time. In between May and July 2016 there was a higher retweet count compared to other years.  The twitter user would use this insight to find out more on what people find interesting so that he can concentrate on that.

## Key Insights for Presentation
- Comparison in the dog stages by the counts
- Comparison between retweet count and favorite count
- Comparison between retweet count and timestamp
